# ✍️ Notes

How to Solve a Coding Challenge:

1. Research that week's method or concept 
- what method are we learnign about this week?
- looki it up in MDN or w3schools
- watch a video
- review your lecture notes
- participate in discussion with other developers about the code 

2. Understand the problem 
- read through the problem 
- identify key words
- identify the requirements for solving the challenge
- identify the inputs 
 * inputs are the arguements our function will take in when its called
- view the for input/output examples

3. create a step-by-step plan (algorithm) for how you'll solve it 
- think about the topic can be applied to solve the code challenge
- create a visual example w inputs to help you get through each step
- create a checklist of everything the function needs to accomplish 
 * fill in small details
- most practical way of creating an algoritm is to focous on the example input/outout in your visual
- consider the steps in your algoritm will take to use the inout in movign towards the output
- work through the problems yourself, looking at the steps you took on the way

4. carry out the plan and write actaul code 
- accomplish  ine task at a time
- complete your function 
- correct any syntax errors
- return your solution
- test to pass

5. look back and possibly refactor your solutin if it could be better
- is it passing the test?
- does it meet all the requirments?
- does it solve the code challange?
- can you understand it, does it make sense?
- can you think of other ways to rewrite it? (smaller)
- how has other people solved this problem?
