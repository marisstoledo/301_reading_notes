# ✍️ Notes
1. List some of JavaScript's data types:
- objects, strings, arrays, and booleans and numbers are all data types

2. In JavaScript, ______ __________ is an object.
- almost everything is an object in JS -arrays, booleans, more All JS values, except primitives, are objects

3. What are "JavaScript Primitives"?
- A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods. A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.


4. How many primitive data types are there?
-  7 data types. string, number, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.

5. What are the three JavaScript Primative Wrapper types?
- JS provides three primitive wrapper types, : Boolean, Number, and string types.

6. What does a JavaScript Primative Wrapper do?
- the primitive wrappers make it easier to call JacaScrip's built-in methods on the primitve vaule 

7. What is the Primative Wrapper doing under the hood when you call a method on a variable that holds a number, a string, or a boolean?
- 

8. What are functions that are binded to an object called?
- methods 

9. So if almost everything in JavaScript is an object, what does that mean for most data types?
- most data types will have their very own special methods built into JavaScript 

10. What do these special built-in methods do?
- a method can accomplsih any number of popukar tasks in programming. A few popluar tasks are: adding, vaules, removing vaules, moving vaules

11. How do we access a method on an object?
- dot notation 

12. How do we use a built-in method on a JavaScript data type?
- use dot notation on the variable name to invoke the method 

13. What kind of built-in methods are we going to learn about in 301?
- array methods
- string methods
- object methods 
- number methods
- math methods

14. Where can you go to learn about the different methods avaiable to each data type?
- google it!
- MDN Web docs
- w3Schools

15. How am I suppose to know what to search for in Google?
- "how to" + "do the thing" + "JavaScript"
