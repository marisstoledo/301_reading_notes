12. What is the purpose of a package.json?
    - It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM. It also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package. It specifies the dependencies being used in the project which helps npm setup the same environment on a different machine for our project.

13. What are node modules?

14. What is the .gitignore?

15. What is the purpose of the public directory?
    - This folder contains the HTML file, index.html. This is the page template and must be named exactly this because it is the template file which is served up when we start our script to launch our app. It is considered best practice not to create multiple html files in the public folder. You would normally only work in this folder when importing css libraries, images and fonts from JavaScript.

16. What is the purpose of the public/index.html?
    -It is the page template. Only files inside the public file can be used from public/index.html. When the application starts this is the first page that is loaded. This will be the only html file in the entire application since React is generally written using JSX. This file has a code of `
